# Business need

The main goal is for the user to check the shipments at a glance. This allows users to take faster decisions and plan ahead of time.

Providing information to the customer increases transparency and reduces communication issues.

**The goal is to set up an application which enables the user to view and manage shipments.**

## The user shall be able to:
- [ ] See shipments in pages of 20 elements per page
- [ ] Search by shipment id
- [ ] Sort by different fields (e.g. id, name) in ascending/descending order
- [ ] View the shipment information on a separate shipment details page
- [ ] Update the shipment name (should persist when the page is reloaded)

The interactions should not refresh the page.

## Important points
The application must start
The application must be a single-page application (SPA)
The application must be divided into components
The file structure must be consistent and easy to follow
The list and details page must cover all use cases with minor issues
The application must include meaningful tests (Tests that do not validate logic or component behavior, e.g. snapshot tests, are not counted)
The application is configurable by environment variables
The application has a development and production environment
The application supports code splitting
The application has good naming
The application computes values
The application is responsive
A component library is created
TypeScript is used
Cross-browser techniques are implemented
Styles are shipped separately
Hot reload is added
