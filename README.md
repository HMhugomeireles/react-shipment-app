# Business need

The main goal is for the user to check the shipments at a glance. This allows users to take faster decisions and plan ahead of time.

Providing information to the customer increases transparency and reduces communication issues.

**The goal is to set up an application which enables the user to view and manage shipments.**

# Use cases

## The user shall be able to:
- [ ] See shipments in pages of 20 elements per page
- [ ] Search by shipment id
- [ ] Sort by different fields (e.g. id, name) in ascending/descending order
- [ ] View the shipment information on a separate shipment details page
- [ ] Update the shipment name (should persist when the page is reloaded)

The interactions should not refresh the page.
